  SU^2 PATH SETUP 
-----------------------------------------------

When make install is complete, please be sure to add the $SU2_HOME and $SU2_RUN environment variables, and update your $PATH with $SU2_RUN. 

For example, add these lines to your .bashrc file -

export SU2_RUN="your_prefix/bin"
export SU2_HOME="your_SU2v2.0/trunk"
export PATH=$PATH:$SU2_RUN

$SU2_RUN should point to the folder where all binaries and python scripts were installed.  This is the prefix you set with ./configure -prefix 

$SU2_HOME should point to the source code's trunk folder.  This is (..)/SU2v2.0/trunk

Thanks for building, and happy optimizing!
